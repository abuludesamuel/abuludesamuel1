<font color="white"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was enrolled in a Daycare which is the early childhood education I can still remember the school vividly Sundest Nursery and Primary School. Actually my mum drop me in the school 7:45am in the morning and i will be picked up in the afternoon around 2:00pm. I go to school Monday-Friday except Saturday and Sunday Daycare is very sweet all you have to do is to sleep, learn and eat this goes for a year by then I started speaking fluently than beofre so i was promoted to Kindergateen 1 (kg 1) then the teaching was different even in the same school but I made a lot of friends so the struggle continue as a young boy in a fragile age. From Kg 1 I started reading the 26 Alphabetical letters off-hand and counting 1...2...3...4... to 10 and this is very easy for me because am a very brilliant boy. Moreover because of my good performance i was given a double promotion to Nursery school. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My normal school life start again this time the work is had but I have no choice but to cope and get well to my nice performance after the end of the first term I performed very well everybody was surprised even my Class teacher was amazed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I got home at the end of the first term I saw my mum and Dad packing our loads into a car i don't know what really happen by then i am 5years old  then with my elder sister we start to move out of that area but all i know is that our former house was a rented house. The journey started we move out of the area completely as a young boy seeing alot of cars and the busy road very happy and pointing around that was wghen travelling has been one of my hobby then we go to a new aprtment. I was surprised Dad has built is own house wow........... that was what i shouted seeing the power supply a clean environment with a clean water but it was hard for me to adapt to the environment but Dad said i should finish my second term & third term  in my school Sundest Nursery and primary school so as not to affect my education so dad start to drop me in the school cause is office is not far from there. I finshed my third term exam i passed as well i greet my friends bye bye cause that is the last time of coming to the school then we vacate for the long holiday<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The following session i was enrolled in another School to start my primary school in a big school far bigger and better than my old school with a clean and condusive environment Grace and Glory international School. My first day in this school was just like a dream cause all student wore their uniform but i look old by wearing mufty my dad paid all my bills(School fees,Uniform,Text book,Exercise books and others). I got my School uniform in a week after and i bought a pair of white socks and a black shoe and i look good and neat. I came first at the end of the section and everybody was surprised in the school cause i was a playful child and i play alot but are surprised how i came first .........four years later.....<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I was on the assembly ground for our normal chapel activities and we were told that the school will elect some prefect and I was selected as the time-keeper which means i will ring the bell for every activites in the school a year after i left primary school and i proceed to the school secondary school
